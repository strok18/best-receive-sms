                                Apple fans may be paying attention to the latest development of ios14 recently.
                                ios14 will have major upgrades and changes in user privacy. The most important
                                manifestation is that the access to application permissions is more transparent,
                                and the ability to completely determine whether their personal information will
                                be To be tracked, the previous version’s approach was that Apple would assign a
                                random device identifier, also known as an advertiser identifier (IDFA), to each
                                user’s device. Usually, advertisers such as facebook, twitter, etc. would
                                directly retrieve the hardware IDFA information for storage Upload and analyze,
                                and finally achieve the purpose of accurately pushing personalized
                                advertisements, as well as personalized mobile phone text messages and email
                                advertisements. But now Apple has finally officially added a protective lock on
                                this muffled road to making big money. You know that in Facebook’s 70 billion
                                annual advertising revenue, personalized push ads account for a large
                                proportion. If you can’t analyze user portraits, and you can’t get hardware
                                information that matches your personal mobile phone number, then accurate
                                advertising will lose meaning and click through rates. Will be cut in half.
